# Google Immersice Hackathon
For the Devpost [Google Immersive Hackathon](https://googlesimmersive.devpost.com/)

## Hyper Immersive Panorama Entry
Hyper Immersive Panoramas detect the users orientation of their head using facial detection and the web camera. The real time facial orientation is then used to allow the user to look left, right, up or down, in the virtual 3D environment.

We also add ambient audio and the ability to walk around using the forward and back keys on the keyboard.
